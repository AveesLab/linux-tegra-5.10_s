Subject: [PATCH 053/830] FROMLIST: modpost: Make static exports fatal
X-NVConfidentiality: public

Using EXPORT_SYMBOL*() on static functions is fundamentally wrong.
Modpost currently reports that as a warning, but clearly this is not a
pattern we should allow, and all in-tree occurences should have been
fixed by now. So, promote the warn() message to fatal() to make sure
this never happens again.
