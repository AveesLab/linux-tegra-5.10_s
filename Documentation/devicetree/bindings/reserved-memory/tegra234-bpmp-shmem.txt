* Tegra CPU-NS - BPMP IPC reserved memory binding

Define a memory region used for communication between CPU-NS and BPMP.
Typically this node is created by the bootloader as the physical address
has to be known to both CPU-NS and BPMP for correct IPC operation.

The memory region is defined using a child node under /reserved-memory.
The sub-node is named shmem@<address> and has the following properties:

- compatible:
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra234-bpmp-shmem";

- reg:
	The physical address and size of the shared SDRAM region

- no-map:
	To prevent the OS from creating a virtual mapping for this region.
	(See reserved-memory.txt for details on the no-map property)

Example:

/ {
	reserved-memory {
		...
		dram_cpu_bpmp_mail: shmem@0xf1be0000  {
			compatible = "nvidia,tegra234-bpmp-shmem";
			reg = <0x0 0xf1be0000 0x0 0x2000>;
			no-map;
		};

		...
	};
};
